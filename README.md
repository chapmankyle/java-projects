Repo for all Java projects

## Current files include:

### *Dodger*
My first game I ever created in Java, which is a take on the games I used to play when I was younger.

You have to dodge traffic for as long as possible while other cars come towards you in three different lanes.

`Game.java` \- Main file used to start the game, found [here][1].

### *Pong*
My very first attempt at making the famous classic game, Pong.

*P.S. It's not very well optimized and it was written in 2014, so don't be too harsh.*

`Game.java` \- Main file used to start the game, found [here][2].

### *Retro Hunter*
Small, incomplete game I've made just to test out animations in Java.
